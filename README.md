# Cookiecutter Data Science template using Snakemake Docker R and python

inspired by:
- [cookiecutter-docker-science](https://github.com/docker-science/cookiecutter-docker-science)
- [cookiecutter data science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/)

# Demo

[cookie_ds_demo repository](https://github.com/erblast/cookie_ds_demo)

# Features:
- CI/CD using travis
- control execution via `snakemake`
- `docker-compose` spins up `RStudio`, `jupyter notebook` and `jekyll`(for github page rendering) server containers
- templates for **test**, **exec** and **job** rules 
- automated documentation builds as github page including snakemake reports, pkgdown website, DAG diagrams of executed workflows and more

# Why use `docker` ?

[data science repo life cycle](https://docker-science.github.io/)

Docker allows us to continuously develop data science applications in the same environment it will be deployed in.


# Why use `cookiecutter` ?

Adding features to a repo that make it deployment ready such as unit testing, CI/CD, automated documentation and logging can be quite laborious and requires some planning. An effort usually not done for ad-hoc analysis. Using a good template makes that effort reusable and we can theoreticall apply it even to small ad-hoc projects without any extra work.


# Why use `snakemake` ?

`snakemake` is an execution manager that tracks file history and only executes those part of the code that have changed since the last run. It is baed on `python` and can integrate `R`, `python` and `shell` commands equally well. It can assign multiple cores to rules that can be executed in parallel and builds sophisticated `html` reports of completed runs.
